(define (accum-time name)
"
   accum-time -- Maintain performance profile manually.

   This allows the programmer to manually instrument specific locations
   in a code base, and obtain the elapsed time spent in those regions.

   Example usage:

      (define actr (accum-time \"foo\"))
      (define bctr (accum-time \"bar\"))
      (actr #:enter? #t) ; start timing foo
      (bctr #:enter? #t) ; start timing bar
      (bctr #:enter? #f) ; stop  timing bar
      (bctr #:enter? #t) ; start timing bar
      (bctr #:enter? #f) ; stop  timing bar
      (bctr #:enter? #t) ; start timing bar
      (bctr #:enter? #f) ; stop  timing bar
      (actr #:enter? #f) ; stop  timing foo
      (actr #:report? #t) ; report foo
      (bctr #:report? #t) ; report bar

   A less abstract example, in the form of a diff:

      +      (define find-parent-ctr (accum-time \"find-parent\"))
      +
      -(define find-parent
      +(define (find-parent a b)
      +       (find-parent-ctr #:enter? #t)
      +       (let ((rv (xfind-parent a b)))
      +       (find-parent-ctr #:enter? #f)
      +       rv))
      +       
      +(define xfind-parent
